### üîç Where to Find Bank Information

- Official bank websites (usually in their "Cr√©ditos Hipotecarios" or "Pr√©stamos UVA" sections)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- Some banks may have different conditions for different customer segments (e.g., "Banco Macro" vs "Banco Macro Selecta")
- Some banks may have special conditions for specific property locations (e.g., "Banco Ciudad - Microcentro")

In those cases just build another entry, with the special case data.
