### Adding New Bank Presets

To add a new bank's mortgage conditions to the calculator, you need to modify the `src/data/mortgagePresets.json` file.

#### File Location
```
src/data/mortgagePresets.json
```

#### JSON Structure

Each bank preset should be an object with the following properties:

```json
{
  "name": "Bank Name",
  "maxFinancialPercentage": 75,
  "interestRate": 4.5,
  "minMortgageDuration": 5,
  "maxMortgageDuration": 30,
  "salaryPaymentRatio": 25
}
```

#### Field Descriptions

| Field | Type | Description | Example |
|-------|------|-------------|---------|
| `name` | string | The official name of the bank + Financial plan name | "Banco Naci√≥n" |
| `maxFinancialPercentage` | number | Maximum percentage of property value that can be financed | 75 (means 75%) |
| `interestRate` | number | Annual interest rate (TNA - Tasa Nominal Anual) | 4.5 (means 4.5%) |
| `minMortgageDuration` | number | Minimum loan term in years | 5 |
| `maxMortgageDuration` | number | Maximum loan term in years | 30 |
| `salaryPaymentRatio` | number | Maximum percentage of salary that can be used for payment | 25 (means 25%) |

#### Example: Adding a New Bank

To add a new bank, append a new object to the existing array in `mortgagePresets.json`:

```json
[
  // ... existing banks ...
  {
    "name": "Banco Example - Payroll Client",

    "interestRate": 7.5,
    "minMortgageDuration": 10,

    "maxFinancialPercentage": 75,
    "interestRate": 12.5,
